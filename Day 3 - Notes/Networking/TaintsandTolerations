On the master node taint one of the node

kubectl taint node gke-cluster-1-default-pool-7fe774cd-0m0q color=red:NoSchedule

This node will be tainted

Now try to create any replicas of deployment, no pod will be scehduled on the tainted node.

This is tainting. 

Now remove the taint:

kubectl taint node gke-cluster-1-default-pool-7fe774cd-0m0q color=red:NoSchedule-


We have 2 types of effect in taint

NoSchedule
NoExecute

Example of NoExecute : in this case the running pods on the node that is tainted will leave the node and get created somewhere else
No new pod will be scheduled on the taineted node as No execute.

example:

Create some replicas and deployemnts, so that pods are there on all nodes

kubectl create -f deployment.yml

Now taint one of the node as :

kubectl taint node gke-cluster-1-default-pool-7fe774cd-0m0q color=red:NoExecute

You will observe that pods form tainted node are terminated
